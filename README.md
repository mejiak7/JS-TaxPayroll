# JS-TaxPayroll
# Challenge-3

# Description
For Challenge-3 I was asked to modify some starter code to create an application that enables a playroll employer to view and manage employee payroll data.

# Layout
I was responsible for writing code for the following functions...

`collectEmployees`
`displayAverageSalary`
`getRandomEmployee`


# collectEmployees
in this function it allows the user to add employee data,
their first name, last name and salary and then give the enduser an option to add another employee or cancel.

# displayAverageSalary
in this function it grabs the generated array of employees and their salary to then calculate the average of the salary between employees and then it console logs the salary average

# getRandomEmployee
in this function it grabs the generated array of employees and randomly select one employee and then console logs a `Congratulations` message along with employee's name.
